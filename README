usbfd is no longer being maintained. I sold the piano I installed the hardware in and have no way to test changes.
If somebody wants to take over the project then drop me a line.

usbfd is intended as a tool to handle USB thumb drives used with USB FDD emulators.

It was written for a GNU/Linux Bash system using a GOTEK 1000 model, YMMV.

Just copy it into your bin folder or somewhere else and chmod +x it so you can run it from the command line.

This: 0.9.1 -
- is the stable initial version that formats, mounts and unmounts (etc...) USB Floppy Emulator images.
Tested extensively with a cheap GOTEK 1000 Floppy Drive Emulator from Ebay which is connected to my Yamaha Clavinova CVP 109 Piano.

It allows you to efficiently manage (mount / unmount / format) whole ranges of floppy images or just one at a time. Then you can use standard OS functions to copy the data to and from the images quickly.

Its a bash script for Linux because all the existing tools for mounting and formatting USB FDD Emulator images are for Windows.
